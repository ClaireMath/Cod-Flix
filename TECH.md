Bootstrap v4.4.1

Bootstrap is a component that simplifies front-end web development (HTML / CSS) by structuring the rendering of pages. 

I haven't included Bootstrap myself, the company I work for did, but I decided to write this file so that other 
developers from my company know why we decided to include bootstrap in our project.

If we decided to use this library, it's because it provides:
● Standardization of page rendering by cutting by column
● Support for responsive design and therefore correct mobile rendering
● Clean display of buttons, forms, modals, etc.

Bootstrap is an Open-Source library (MIT license). 
This allows Cod'Flix to freely modify the code if the need arises. 
There are no a priori security risks concerning this library since it only concerns 
the pure display of elements in HTML.

This library is widely used and the community is active:
● Used by 21% of all websites (source:
https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-bootstrap)
● 142,000 stars on GitHub (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
● Over 350,000 questions on StackOverflow
● Development remains active with commits dating from June 2020

Codflix also chose to use :

The Spark framework to handle the routing, requests and responses handling, etc.
